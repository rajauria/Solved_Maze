## Maze Solver 

The Solved Maze project is built using Java. The primary focus of the project is to create a maze solver with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. The key element of this project is to implement a DFS algorithm to find the path from the starting to the ending point in the maze. To facilitate the construction of the graphical interface, JFrames will be used as the top-level containers provided by Java Swing.
